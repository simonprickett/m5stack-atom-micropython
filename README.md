# M5Stack Atom Matrix MicroPython Live Streams

![M5Stack Atom Matrix](m5stack_atom.png)

## Introduction

This repository contains the code that accompanies my live streaming series in which I played around with installing and running MicroPython code on the M5Stack Atom Matrix device.

## Videos

Check out the videos on YouTube (click the images to view -- come on GitHub we needed YouTube embeds in README files!)...

In episode 1 I installed MicroPython and wrote code to use the LEDs and button.  Then I demonstrated how to connect to WiFi and read and display the current Cheerlights color using an MQTT broker.

Episode 2 to follow!  Subscribe on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@simonprickett) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/simon_prickett) to be notified when it's happening.  My live streams also go out on LinkedIn and Twitch if you prefer.

## Find this Useful?

If you found this useful and would like to see me make more of this sort of thing, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/simonprickett).  All proceeds will be spent on purchasing more devices / sensors etc for future projects which will all be open sourced.  Thanks!
